I'm working through a course I purchased on Udemy. Today, I focused on solving problems using the \"sliding window\" technique. Day 2: Worked on developing a microservice at work that receieves and logs client errors. I also spent some time reading about preventing SQL injections in Go and other vulnerabilities. Day 3: Spent today learning and practicing recursion. One problem led me down an interesting rabbit hole about the different ways to remove the last element of an array in javascript. There are three different ways to do it, and each method returns something different. Definitely a good review of some of javascript's built in methods. Today, for 100 days of code I took a deep dive into the golang docs to learn more about the built in log functionality. I also watched a couple videos on this topic too. For day 6 0f 100 days of code, I continued looking into logging. Understanding the common components that go into a log like timestamp, stack trace, a unique ID etc. I worked on getting the POST endpoint for the logging microservice up and running. For day 7 of 100 days of code, I finished up the linear search section of the data structures and algorithms course and started learning about binary search. Most of the hour (and some additional time) was dedicated to solving the first problem that was introduced. Today, I learned about sorting algorithms and practiced implementing the bubble sort.","title":"docs/Bola.md"},{"location":"Castillo/","text":"Finished job scrapping app. Link to repo: https://github.com/crc8109/job-scraper Link to live project: https://repl.it/@crc8109/job-scraper#README.md Started a git tutorial.

Got basic data from repo. Day 2 Contributed to the pip repo so that I could do more advanced git stuff (see https://github.com/juanbenitopr/python-git-wrapper/pull/6) Day 3 Added graphics with some basic matplotlib and some seaborn magic. Created github workflows and tried to handle github artifacts for the image. Artifacts are a little broken rn (can only download zips) so was disappointed. Day 4 Lol, over did the readme page, made a github pages site and added badges for 100 days of code. Also fixed some of the caching issues. Day 5 Does work count? Worked on a visualization with Manim for an upcoming presentation. I fixed a bug with my CI in my research code, and I read up on using CSE for FMM + means of numerically calculating Cauchy integrals incase I want to go down the numerical FMM route (with Laurent series) for the equations I've been wrestling with. Also fixed a bug or two with the BBT 100 Days of code CI. Day 6 I went viral ! Made a nice d3 vis in observablehq.com of the parachute of the perseverance rover Spliced together some footage of the actual parachute + posted to reddit Day 7 Made a fun little site for Irene's dog Frida :tada: Day 8 Translated an old project from tensorflow 1 to to tensorflow 2. Pretty annoying tbh, pretty large api changes. Day 9 Did project euler problems 53, 59, 84 in haskell . Day 10 I explored using serverless cells on Observable as a means of creating an endpoint for generating graphics. I integrated this pipeline into my CI for project Euler problems . Pretty cool mini-project overall, and would likely use this method again. Day 11 I've been on my observable grind. For day 11, I implemented a radix tree + d3 to visulize toki pona: https://next.observablehq.com/@dmadisetti/toki-pona-radix-tree Day 12 Made a github template for Baltimore Black Techies Haskell talk Day 13 Started a rust TUI app . Will update when we're done ;) Day 14 Released TUI app , and published to cargo Day 15 I posted to social about the tui and had a good response. I spent sometime putting in unit tests and fixing a uft8 bug. Good opportunity to learn more about rust unit testing. Day 16 I created a programming language based off toki pona lol. Gained semi-virality.
