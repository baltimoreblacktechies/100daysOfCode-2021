The challenge to code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

Just a repository for members of BBT to share some of their little scripting projects. Let's see if we can get 100 days of code together!

## FAQ:

### What Is The #100DaysOfCode Challenge?

  100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based   on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community—you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay  motivated to document your own.

### How Can I Participate?

  Do #100DaysOfCode with Baltimore Black Techies!

At the end of your 100 days coding with us, you’ll get a host of experience and several friends that have taken part in this challenge.
