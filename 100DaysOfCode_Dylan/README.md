# 100 Days of code
a personal log
---

## Day 1

Wrote the basic code tracker script. Found a nice pip package to wrap git, but
it wasn't great. Got basic data from repo.


## Day 2

Contributed to the pip repo so that I could do more advanced git stuff (see
https://github.com/juanbenitopr/python-git-wrapper/pull/6)

## Day 3

Added graphics with some basic matplotlib and some seaborn magic. Created
github workflows and tried to handle github artifacts for the image. Artifacts
are a little broken rn (can only download zips) so was disappointed.

## Day 4

Lol, over did the readme page, made a github pages site and added badges for
100 days of code. Also fixed some of the caching issues.

## Day 5

Does work count? Worked on a visualization with
[Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) for an upcoming presentation.
I fixed a bug with my CI in my research code, and I read up on using CSE for
FMM + means of numerically calculating Cauchy integrals incase I want to go
down the numerical FMM route (with Laurent series) for the equations I've
been wrestling with. Also fixed a bug or two with the BBT 100 Days of code
CI.
