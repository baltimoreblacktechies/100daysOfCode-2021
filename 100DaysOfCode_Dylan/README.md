# 100 Days of code
a personal log
---

## Day 1

Wrote the basic code tracker script. Found a nice pip package to wrap git, but
it wasn't great. Got basic data from repo.


## Day 2

Contributed to the pip repo so that I could do more advanced git stuff (see
https://github.com/juanbenitopr/python-git-wrapper/pull/6)

## Day 3

Added graphics with some basic matplotlib and some seaborn magic. Created
github workflows and tried to handle github artifacts for the image. Artifacts
are a little broken rn (can only download zips) so was disappointed.

## Day 4

Lol, over did the readme page, made a github pages site and added badges for
100 days of code. Also fixed some of the caching issues.

## Day 5

Does work count? Worked on a visualization with
[Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) for an upcoming presentation.
I fixed a bug with my CI in my research code, and I read up on using CSE for
FMM + means of numerically calculating Cauchy integrals incase I want to go
down the numerical FMM route (with Laurent series) for the equations I've
been wrestling with. Also fixed a bug or two with the BBT 100 Days of code
CI.

## Day 6

I went viral !

Made a nice d3 vis in observablehq.com of the parachute of the [perseverance rover](https://observablehq.com/@dmadisetti/perseverance-parachute)
Spliced together some footage of the actual parachute + [posted to reddit](https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lqgset/oc_decoding_the_stars_visualizing_the_message_in/)

## Day 7

Made a fun little site for Irene's dog [Frida](https://www.frida.kim) :tada:

## Day 8

Translated an old project from tensorflow 1 to to tensorflow 2. Pretty annoying tbh, pretty large api changes.

## Day 9

Did project euler problems 53, 59, [84](https://github.com/dmadisetti/painfulHaskell/commit/d6e6fc6bd4447423cb4df05b55b139609c26eb12)
in [haskell](https://github.com/dmadisetti/painfulHaskell/).
