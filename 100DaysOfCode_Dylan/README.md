# 100 Days of code
a personal log
---

## Day 1

Wrote the basic code tracker script. Found a nice pip package to wrap git, but
it wasn't great. Got basic data from repo.


## Day 2

Contributed to the pip repo so that I could do more advanced git stuff (see
https://github.com/juanbenitopr/python-git-wrapper/pull/6)

## Day 3

Added graphics with some basic matplotlib and some seaborn magic. Created
github workflows and tried to handle github artifacts for the image. Artifacts
are a little broken rn (can only download zips) so was disappointed.

## Day 4

Lol, over did the readme page, made a github pages site and added badges for
100 days of code. Also fixed some of the caching issues.
